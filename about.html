        <h1>Our Story</h1>
        <p>
          It began with a vision, a passion for computer science education, and the need to serve teachers on a global level. The Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA) is a membership organization that supports and promotes the teaching of computer science. CSTA provides opportunities for Kâ€“12 teachers and their students to better understand computer science and to more successfully prepare themselves to teach and learn. Founded by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) in 2004, CSTA has grown into a dynamic and vibrant organization of professionals interested in supporting computer science education in K-12. Today, our membership consists of  more than 25,000 members from more than 145 countries. These members include elementary, middle, and high school teachers; college and university faculty; supportive members of industry and government, school administrators, other non-profits, and parents.
